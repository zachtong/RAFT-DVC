# RAFT-DVC Project Rules

## Language Policy
- **Communication**: Always use Chinese (中文) when talking to the user
- **Code & Comments**: Always use English for all code, comments, variable names, commit messages, and technical documentation

## Testing Policy — Visual PDF Reports

When a new feature is developed or an existing feature is significantly modified:

1. **Generate a visual PDF test report** and save it to `reports/` folder
2. The report filename should be descriptive: `reports/<feature_name>_report_<YYYY-MM-DD>.pdf`
3. The report must help the user intuitively understand the feature's:
   - **Effect** — field maps, displacement/strain visualizations, before/after comparisons
   - **Performance** — timing benchmarks, throughput metrics, convergence curves
   - **Boundary conditions** — behavior at edges, with noise, at extreme parameters
   - **Limitations** — failure cases, accuracy degradation, known constraints
4. Include as appropriate: field maps, error distributions, summary tables, comparison charts
5. After generating the report, **always tell the user the exact file path and name**

## Non-Regression Policy

When modifying functionality:
- **Never degrade core features** that the user has previously validated and locked down
- If a change risks affecting existing behavior, verify the old behavior still works before claiming completion
- When in doubt, run existing tests or create comparison tests against the previous implementation

## Memory Policy

- Save important project context, decisions, and user preferences to the memory system
- Memory directory: `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-13014-OneDrive---The-University-of-Texas-at-Austin-Documents-Python-Codes-RAFT-DVC/memory/`
- Update memories when learning new project facts or receiving user corrections

## Storage Policy — TACC Vista

- `$WORK` (1 TB, persistent): code repo, conda env, curated `checkpoint_best.pth`
- `$SCRATCH` (tens of TB, 10-day purge): **all datasets** (Phase-1 ~60 GB,
  Phase-2/3 multi-TB 128³/256³), training run logs, TensorBoard events
- `$HOME` (~10 GB): `.bashrc`, SSH keys only

Datasets live on `$SCRATCH` because `$WORK` cannot hold multi-TB data. Use a
touch-based keepalive in the SLURM script to refresh atime and avoid purge.

## Archive Policy

- Do **not** import from `archive/` in new code
- Do **not** modify `archive/` files except to add pointers to successors
- If resurrecting something: copy out, rename to avoid confusion

## Legacy Inference Module

- `src/legacy_inference/` is DEPRECATED for Phase-1/2 pipelines
- It is retained for Phase-3 real-data inference (VolRAFT comparison,
  experimental confocal data) and must not be imported for synthetic
  val/test evaluation — use `scripts/phase1/evaluate_phase1.py` instead
