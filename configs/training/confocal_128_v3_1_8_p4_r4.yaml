# Training Configuration for RAFT-DVC
# V3: Uses original confocal_128 dataset (v1) instead of v2
# All other parameters identical to v2
#
# NOTE: Model architecture must be specified separately via --model-config
#       This file only contains training-related parameters (data, optimizer, scheduler)

# Data settings
data:
  train_dir: "data/synthetic_confocal_128/train"
  val_dir: "data/synthetic_confocal_128/val"
  test_dir: "data/synthetic_confocal_128/test"

  # Data augmentation
  augment: true # Random flips and rotations

  # Patch extraction (set to null to use full volumes)
  # For 128^3 volumes, can train on full size or patches
  patch_size: null # [64, 64, 64] for patches, null for full volume

  # Number of workers for data loading
  num_workers: 4

# Training settings
training:
  # Basic settings
  epochs: 300 # Extended from 100 to 300 for continued training
  batch_size: 5 # 128^3 volumes, batch_size=2 should fit in 32GB GPU

  # Optimizer
  optimizer: "AdamW"
  lr: 0.0001 # This is used by optimizer, but scheduler controls actual LR
  weight_decay: 0.00005 # Reduced to match volRAFT (5e-5 instead of 1e-4)

  # Learning rate scheduler - CyclicLR (matches volRAFT)
  scheduler: "CyclicLR"
  base_lr: 0.00005 # 5e-5 - Higher starting LR for continued training
  max_lr: 0.0001 # 1e-4 - Lower peak LR (half of original)
  step_size_up: 500 # Iterations to ramp up (matches volRAFT)
  step_size_down: 1500 # Iterations to ramp down (matches volRAFT)
  mode: "triangular2" # Amplitude decreases each cycle

  # Gradient clipping
  clip_grad_norm: 1.0

  # Mixed precision training
  use_amp: true # Automatic Mixed Precision (saves memory)

  # Loss weights (RAFT uses gamma-weighted loss)
  gamma: 0.8 # Exponential weight for intermediate predictions

  # Validation
  val_freq: 5 # Validate every N epochs
  save_freq: 25 # Save checkpoint every N epochs

# Evaluation settings
evaluation:
  # Metrics to compute
  metrics:
    - "EPE" # End-Point Error
    - "1px" # Percentage of pixels with EPE < 1
    - "3px" # Percentage of pixels with EPE < 3
    - "5px" # Percentage of pixels with EPE < 5

  # Inference iterations (can be different from training)
  iters: 12 # More iterations for better accuracy during eval

# Output settings
output:
  output_dir: "outputs/training/confocal_128_v3_1_8_p4_r4"
  experiment_name: "raft_dvc_confocal_128_v3_1_8_p4_r4"

  # Logging
  log_freq: 10 # Log every N iterations
  tensorboard: true
  save_visualizations: true # Save sample predictions during validation

# Checkpoint
checkpoint:
  resume: # Resume from the latest model
  save_best: true # Save best model based on validation EPE

# Hardware
