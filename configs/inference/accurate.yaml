# Inference strategy: accurate
# Two-stage: coarse localization + fine refinement
# Best sub-voxel precision, slower speed.

  Two-stage strategy for maximum precision.
  Stage 1 uses 1/4 internal downsampling with a 4-level pyramid
  to quickly capture large displacements.
  Stage 2 operates at full resolution with a 2-level pyramid
  to refine to sub-voxel accuracy.

stages:
  - name: coarse
    model: coarse_p4_r4
    internal_downsample: 4
    tile_size: 32
    overlap: 8
    iters: 12
    weight_type: cosine

  - name: fine
    model: fine_p2_r4
    internal_downsample: 1
    tile_size: 32
    overlap: 8
    iters: 12
    weight_type: cosine
