# Inference strategy: balanced
# Two-stage with moderate internal downsampling
# Good tradeoff between speed and precision.

description: >
  Two-stage strategy with moderate settings.
  Stage 1 uses 1/2 internal downsampling for coarse localization.
  Stage 2 operates at full resolution for refinement.
  Faster than 'accurate' with slightly lower precision.

stages:
  - name: coarse
    model: coarse_p4_r4
    internal_downsample: 2
    tile_size: 32
    overlap: 8
    iters: 12
    weight_type: cosine

  - name: fine
    model: fine_p2_r4
    internal_downsample: 1
    tile_size: 32
    overlap: 8
    iters: 12
    weight_type: cosine
