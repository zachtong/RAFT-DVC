# Model Configuration: RAFT-DVC with 1/2 Resolution Encoder
# High-resolution architecture for fine displacement estimation

name: "RAFT-DVC-1/2-P2-R4"
description: >
  RAFT-DVC model with 1/2 resolution feature encoder (shallow downsampling).
  High spatial resolution for sub-voxel precision DVC measurements.
  Inspired by RAFT-DIC findings that reduced pyramid levels improve sub-pixel accuracy.
  RECOMMENDED for fine-scale deformation analysis.

  notes: >
    This configuration follows the RAFT-DIC paper's finding that
    reducing correlation pyramid levels (from 4 to 2) improves
    sub-pixel accuracy for Digital Image Correlation tasks.
